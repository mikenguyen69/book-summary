## Chapter 1 - Professionalism 

* Being a professional means taking full responsibility for one's actions.
> "What would happen if you allowed a bug to slip through a module, and it cost your company $10,000?". The non-professional would shrug his shoulders, say 'stuff happens', and start writing the next module. The professional would write the company a check for $10,000!"
* _[real disaster story about field-failure of a routine each test of which took hours]_
First rule is not doing harm to the function nor the structure of the software. 
* You will always make occasional mistakes, but you must learn from each. Promptly 

You should be certain about all code you release and firmly expect QA to find nothing wrong with it.
* Test it. Test it again.
* Automate your tests.
* Demand 100% coverage.
* Design your code to be easy to test.

You should follow the Boy Scout rule and always leave a module a little cleaner than you found it so that it becomes easier to change over time, not harder.
* Suitable automated tests can allow you to not be afraid to change the code and continually changing it makes sure it stays that way	

Your career is your responsibility, not your boss nor your employers. 
* Spending 20 hours a week beyond your normal work to improve your knowledge and skills 
* Read, experiment, practice (kata), talk to other, collaborate, look over the fence, mentor 
* It should be fun.

Also, know your domain, identify with your customer (no "us vs. them", ever).
* Be aware of arrogance inherent in programming and learn to be humble, too.
