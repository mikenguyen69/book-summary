## Chapter 1 - Professionalism 

* Being a professional means taking full responsibility for one's actions.
> "What would happen if you allowed a bug to slip through a module, and it cost your company $10,000?". The non-professional would shrug his shoulders, say 'stuff happens', and start writing the next module. The professional would write the company a check for $10,000!"
* _[real disaster story about field-failure of a routine each test of which took hours]_

First rule is not doing harm to the function nor the structure of the software. 
* You will always make occasional mistakes, but you must learn from each. Promptly 

You should be certain about all code you release and firmly expect QA to find nothing wrong with it.
* Test it. Test it again.
* Automate your tests.
* Demand 100% coverage.
* Design your code to be easy to test.

You should follow the Boy Scout rule and always leave a module a little cleaner than you found it so that it becomes easier to change over time, not harder.
* Suitable automated tests can allow you to not be afraid to change the code and continually changing it makes sure it stays that way	

Your career is your responsibility, not your boss nor your employers. 
* Spending 20 hours a week beyond your normal work to improve your knowledge and skills 
* Read, experiment, practice (kata), talk to other, collaborate, look over the fence, mentor 
* It should be fun.

Also, know your domain, identify with your customer (no "us vs. them", ever).
* Be aware of arrogance inherent in programming and learn to be humble, too.


## Chapter 2 - Saying No
* Real disaster story about premature deployment of a totally immature distributed system
* Professionals speak truth to power. Professionals have the courage to say no to their managers.
* Managers and developers have roles that are often adversarial, because on the short term, their goals tend to conflict.
* The manager will defend her objectives, but will also expect you to defend yours for the best overall outcome, which is reaching the largest goal that you and the manager share, which may be tricky to determine
* The higher the stakes, the more valuable a "no" becomes, and the harder to say. 
* Good teams will successfully work towards a yes, but only a right yes, that will later work out in practice. 
* Saying "no" is often a prerequisite for getting that right yes. 


## Chapter 3 - Saying Yes

There are three parts to making a commitment
* You say you will do it
* You mean it
* You actually do it
	 
* A professional will not stop after step 1 or step 2. 

Unconditional commitment always takes a form equivalent to "I will achieve goal X until time Y"
* Commitment means taking full responsibility. 
* Most results depend on conditions you cannot fully control, so you will often only commit to actions or commit only conditionally
 
Your commitment must respect the limits of what you expect (based on your experience) you can and cannot do
* If you recognize you will probably not be able to meet a commitment, you need to raise a red flag immediately
